## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of hiding messages or information within other non-secret text or data. This repository contains a series of CTF challenges that require participants to uncover hidden information using various steganographic techniques.

## Challenges

The repository includes multiple challenges of varying difficulty levels. Each challenge is located in its own directory and contains the following:

- A challenge description
- The files containing the hidden information
- Instructions on how to solve the challenge

## Setup

To get started with the challenges, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codewizardSumit/hard-steganography-ctf.git
cd hard-steganography-ctf
```

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed to solve the challenges. Some common tools used for steganography include:

- `steghide`
- `exiftool`
- `zsteg`
- `binwalk`
- `foremost`

## Usage

```sh
cd hard-steganography-ctf
# you are good to go
```
